This is the binned data used to run the bayestack code

1. The first step is to prepare the optical/NIR data (which is breifly explained in data section and fully explained in the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09797).   
2. Run the cosmos_sf.py file which selects galaxies and saves them into different files according to their redshifts
3. Run flux_extract.py to extract the flux-densities from the different redshifts
4. run binner_settings_lf.py to bin the flux-densities
